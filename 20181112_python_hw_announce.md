# Notes on Python coding homework

Dear fellow students,

Hereby I leave notes on scoring for Python codes for HW2, 3, 4.

## HW2

- I tried to be as generous as possible.
- I debugged 12 codes, which did not follow the style guide given or terminated with error.
  Only a small part of scores from correctness was deducted from the codes which required debugging. You may check your correctness score.
- Python 2: There is only one code which run with Python version 2.7.10, and I set up the virtual environment for Python 2.7.15.(I use anaconda; see `conda create` for how to to this), and no problem came from the different version.
- I send sincerest thanks for those who made their code work at once.
- Kind commenting and effort to make the name of functions and variables readable was applied to readability score.
- Running time was measured by randomly generated directed graph with 100 nodes.
  - All the codes that worked for the graph given with the problem yielded right answer for 100 nodes graph.
  - Fastest running code was submitted by **Xiaojuan Jiang**. Congrats!

## HW3

- Almost everybody followed the style guide.
- I can see that this assignment was really tough.
- Running time was measured by randomly generated assignment cost matrix with 48 agents.
  - Only codes from two students, **Yoojin Na** and **Gyunam Park** worked for the large matrix and yielded right answer. Contrats!
  - For those who want to claim your code works for the large matrix on your computer, find TA. I will check by remote desktop or your laptop and fix given score.

## HW4

- Everybody who submitted followed the style guide.
- Running time was measured by randomly generated directed graph with 240 nodes. All the codes that worked for the graph given with the problem yielded right answer for 240 nodes graph.
  - Fastest running code was submitted by **Kijae Hong**. Congrats!

## Later homeworks

- Input data
  - Total 3 dataset will be given.
    - Small dataset
      - to enable **manual check** of correctness
    - Medium-sized dataset
      - to **score correctness**
    - Large-sized dataset
      - only to check **running time**
- Running
  - TA uses computer with Linux OS(Fedora 29 server) on Ryzen 2600X to check running time.
  - For those who want to test their own code on the scoring environment, always ask TA. I will gladly help them.
